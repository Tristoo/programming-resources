1. The back-end is how the website runs, changes, and updates itself. 
This basically consists of everything the user can't see, such as databases and servers. 
Usually people who work on the back-end are called programmers or developers. 
Back-end developers are mostly worried about things like security, structure and content management.  
Back-end development is required to create a dynamic site.   
A dynamic site requires a database to work properly.  All  information, like user profiles or  images they've uploaded, or blog posts, are stored in the database.

This is a great resource as it's step by step. It also provides a quiz at the end so you can test your knowledge.

This is very nice as it's straight to the point. A quick read on the basics you need to know.

This video is great as it compares front-ends with back-ends while also giving visual demonstrations.

2. SQL's are Stored in a relational model, with rows and columns. Rows contain all of the information about one entry and columns seperate the data points.
Whereas NoSQL databases encompasses a host of databases, each with different data storage models. The main ones are: document, graph, key-value and columnar.
  SQL also uses structured query language for defining and manipulating data. 
In No SQL databases, queries are focused on the collection of documents or UnQL (unstructured query language).  
Both technologies are best in what they do and it is up to the developer to decide which to use in a certain situation.

I've always used w3 schools in order to learn for any type of programming. I love how simple it is and how it shoes examples on how to utilize the code.

Great video on getting started with SQL. Videos are the best as you can go along with it whilst applying it yourself.
