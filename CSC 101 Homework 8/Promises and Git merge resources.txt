3. I usually start looking for help on javascript questions by using w3schools. It's great because it provides you with example code on how to run specific problems.
Promises represent a value that we can handle at some point in the future. They give us guarantees about that future value.
They give us a much better way to control asynchronous program flow than plain callbacks.

Git mergetool gets launched to show merges. It is launched to resolve merge conflicts after the merge.
The tool will automatically edit texts with error, when it has resolved everything, simply closing it will result in a save and exit.
